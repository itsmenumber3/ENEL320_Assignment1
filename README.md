ENEL320: Communications and Signals
Assignment 1 
The selected waveform for this assignment was a ‘cut full bridge single phase’ waveform. This is simply an absolute sinusoid turned on at some point before the end of its period. The piece wise approximation of this function is as follows:
f(t)=
{ 0          , t%T<u}   
{ abs(sin(t)), otherwise}
Where T is the period of the waveform and u is the point on that period where the turning on occurs.
